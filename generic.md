<p>The objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms through which senior individuals navigate and counteract misinformation related to the coronavirus on digital platforms. This inquiry focuses on delineating the specific obstacles encountered by this demographic in the pursuit of accurate information online and explores their strategies for addressing these challenges amidst the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Employing methodologies such as online questionnaires and telephonic interviews, this study aims to assess the extent of engagement of older adults with digital resources for acquiring information about COVID-19, their exposure to and interaction with misinformation concerning the virus, and their level of acquaintance with the countermeasures implemented by various online platforms to mitigate the spread of such misinformation.</p>

<p>The project aims to explore accessible methods in enhancing intimacy and interpersonal connections within family units to ameliorate the efficacy and harmony of online misinformation correction. Recognizing the pivotal role of family members in mitigating misinformation dissemination, this research underscores the potency of close personal ties in confronting and rectifying erroneous beliefs circulated online. Amidst the backdrop of increasing reliance on computer-mediated communication (CMC) platforms for information exchange, which simultaneously facilitates and impedes misinformation correction due to the absence of non-verbal cues and emotional depth. </p>
<p>This study seeks to explore innovative communication tools that augment intimacy. By focusing on strategies such as the incorporation of user-personalized elements and contextually rich communication cues in online interactions, this research endeavors to foster more meaningful and effective dialogue. Previous findings suggest the efficacy of emojis features in enhancing communicative clarity, intention, and perceived closeness among interlocutors, positing these tools as potential mediums for fostering greater intimacy and, by extension, more harmonious correction of misinformation within familial circles.</p>
