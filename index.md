Welcome to a nexus where curiosity meets innovation.

I'm a master of information studies student at McGill, as well as a passionate explorer at the intersection of technology and human experience. My academic journey commenced with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Toronto, where I developed a keen interest in the intricacies of the human mind and its interaction with technology. Therefore, I am diving deep into the world of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience Design.

Currently, I am engaged in research at McGill's ACT Lab, supervised by Prof. Karyn Moffatt. My research is dedicated to enhancing the accessibility of technology for vulnerable groups, striving to bridge gaps and create inclusive digital environments.

Outside the academic sphere, my passions lie in literature and music. I am an avid reader, a novelist at heart, and a violinist by choice. These are not mere pastimes but integral parts of who I am, infusing my professional path with rich creativity and profound empathy.

Join me in this tapestry of learning, innovation, and artistic expression, where each thread is interwoven with a commitment to making technology accessible and meaningful for all.
