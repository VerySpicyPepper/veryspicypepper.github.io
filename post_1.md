			<h1>Motivation</h1>
		</header>
    
<p> I am an avid video game player, and I spend at least 20 hours a week playing games. Therefore, when considering the design of my first app work, it was logical that I wanted to involve in the gaming related field.</p>

<p>I'm trying to recall my gaming experience, then, I came up with the idea of <strong>trading game items</strong>. Game items can affect the player's gaming experience. However, as a virtual item, trading game items is not as intuitive and convenient as going to the grocery store and buying a carrot in the vegetable section; when browsing the game item trading market, we may notice that these items are more like being placed in a flea market stall without a clear categorization or pricing standard, requiring players to go through a lot of effort to pick their desired items.</p>

<p>If these game items are categorized and placed like in a <strong>grocery store</strong>, with clear price tags and detailed descriptions, and then provided with a secure trading platform, it would be very easy for players to find the items they want.</p>

</ul>

<br>

<p>	My primary target group comprises players of <strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong>, a cornerstone of the competitive gaming world. This demographic is chosen with strategic insight, recognizing that items from Counter-Strike 2 are among the most actively traded commodities on <strong>Steam</strong>, one of the largest digital distribution platforms for PC gaming. </p>
<p>	The game's enduring popularity, combined with a vibrant ecosystem of in-game items, skins, and accessories, provides a fertile ground for my app.</p>

		<h3>Research Goals</h3>
		<p>	To better understand the gaming community's needs and pain points related to trading game items, I conducted an online survey. My goal was to gather insights into players' experiences with existing trading platforms and identify opportunities for improvement. This survey was administered as an online questionnaire, ensuring a wide reach and easy participation for players globally.</p>
