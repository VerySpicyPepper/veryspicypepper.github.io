			<h1>Motivation</h1>
		</header>
    
<p> I am an avid video game player, and I spend at least 20 hours a week playing games. Therefore, when considering the design of my first app work, it was logical that I wanted to involve in the gaming related field.</p>

<p>I'm trying to recall my gaming experience, then, I came up with the idea of <strong>trading game items</strong>. Game items can affect the player's gaming experience. However, as a virtual item, trading game items is not as intuitive and convenient as going to the grocery store and buying a carrot in the vegetable section; when browsing the game item trading market, we may notice that these items are more like being placed in a flea market stall without a clear categorization or pricing standard, requiring players to go through a lot of effort to pick their desired items.</p>

<p>If these game items are categorized and placed like in a <strong>grocery store</strong>, with clear price tags and detailed descriptions, and then provided with a secure trading platform, it would be very easy for players to find the items they want.</p>

<br>
	<h3>Target group</h3>

<br>

<p>	My primary target group comprises players of <strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong>, a cornerstone of the competitive gaming world. This demographic is chosen with strategic insight, recognizing that items from Counter-Strike 2 are among the most actively traded commodities on <strong>Steam</strong>, one of the largest digital distribution platforms for PC gaming. </p>
<p>	The game's enduring popularity, combined with a vibrant ecosystem of in-game items, skins, and accessories, provides a fertile ground for my app.</p>
